Quick-start instructions for testing your implementation of MessageReceiver

Running under BlueJ:

- Load this project.

- Invoke method runTest() by right-clicking directly on
  class TestReceiver.  It's a static method so you don't
  need to create an object first.

- Enter test frames in the BlueJ terminal window.
  Type a single dot (.) to stop the test.

- See documentation for class TestReceiver for further info
  (or see comments at start of TestReceiver.java).

Running from a command line:

- Compile all java source files (there should be 4)

- Execute TestReceiver (enter command java TestReceiver)
