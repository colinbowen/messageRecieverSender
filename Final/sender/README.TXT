Quick-start instructions for testing your implementation of MessageSender

Running under BlueJ:

- Load this project.

- Invoke method runTest() by right-clicking directly on
  class TestSender.  It's a static method so you don't
  need to create an object first.

- Enter test messages in the BlueJ terminal window.
  Type a single dot (.) to stop the test.

- See documentation for class TestSender for further info
  (or see comments at start of TestSender.java).

Running from a command line:

- Compile all java source files (there should be 4)

- Execute TestSender (enter command java TestSender)
