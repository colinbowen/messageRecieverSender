/**
 * This class implements the receiver side of the physical layer.
 * <P>
 * The source code supplied is already complete.  It does NOT
 * need to be changed and will NOT be submitted for assessment.
 * You may, if you wish, alter the methods in this class for the
 * purpose of debugging your implementation of MessageReceiver,
 * but be careful not to change the interface.
 * <P>
 * In this implementation of the class, frames are read from
 * standard input (normally the keyboard).  Each line of input is
 * treated as a separate frame.  See comments in receiveFrame
 * method regarding detection of the end of the input stream.
